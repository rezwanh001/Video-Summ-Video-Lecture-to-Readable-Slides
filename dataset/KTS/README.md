## KTS (Kernel Temporal Segmentation)
----
* What is KTS?
    - Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) method splits the video into a set of non-intersecting temporal segments. The method is fast and accurate when combined with high-dimensional descriptors. Temporal segmentation approach is a kernel-based change point detection algorithm.
